[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO/main)
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` and `YOUR-REPO` with your GitHub username and repository name. Change `main` if your default branch is named differently (like `master`).

### 3. **Launch Binder**
- Click the badge in your README
- Binder will build an environment from your repo
- First launch takes 5-10 minutes (cached afterward)
- You'll get a JupyterLab interface to run your code

### 4. **Optional: Add Jupyter notebooks**
If you have `.ipynb` files in your repo, they'll be automatically available in the Binder environment.

## Example Repository Structure
